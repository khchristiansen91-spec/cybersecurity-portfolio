# Hidden Malware Hunt

This project showcases advanced forensics and network analysis to uncover a stealthy backdoor hidden in benign traffic and memory dumps. It demonstrates how to find malicious activity that is almost impossible to detect using traditional methods.

## Scenario

A company experiences intermittent anomalies but no obvious indicators of compromise. The goal is to identify a persistent threat that blends into normal system processes and network traffic.

## Methodology

- Acquire network traffic (PCAP files) and memory dumps from suspect hosts.
- Use tools like Volatility and Wireshark/Zeek to parse memory and traffic.
- Write Python scripts to perform anomaly detection on system calls and packet metadata.
- Develop YARA rules to match obfuscated malware code in memory.
- Validate findings by replicating and analyzing the malware in a sandbox.

## Key Findings

- Discovered a hidden process injecting code into `svchost.exe`, using string obfuscation to avoid signatures.
- Identified covert communication over DNS tunneling to an attacker-controlled domain.
- Mapped command-and-control behaviors and persistence mechanisms.

## Deliverables

- A detailed analysis report with screenshots, findings, and recommended defenses.
- YARA rule set and Sigma rules for detecting similar threats.
- Python scripts used for memory and network analysis.
- Sample data (PCAP and memory images) with instructions for reproducing the investigation.
