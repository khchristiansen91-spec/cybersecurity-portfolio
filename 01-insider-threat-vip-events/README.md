# Insider Threat Mitigation for VIP Events

This project presents a detailed case study and policy framework for mitigating insider threats at VIP events. It combines research on past incidents, best practices from corporate security programs, and my own threat modelling analysis to create a holistic strategy.

## Case Study & Report

- **Detailed Report (PDF)** — The included PDF (`Insider_Threat_Mitigation_VIP_Events.pdf`) describes the threat landscape, key controls, and recommendations in depth, along with a narrative of how an insider plot might unfold and how to counter it.
- **Executive Summary** — A concise overview of the findings and recommendations for executives and stakeholders.

## Key Controls

- **Security Awareness Training:** Regular sessions for all staff (including temporary workers) on recognizing phishing, social engineering, and following proper procedures.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Role‑based access control ensures staff only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks and reduces the blast radius of compromised accounts.
- **Anonymous Reporting:** Clear, no‑retaliation channels for staff to report suspicious behavior and encourage a security‑first culture.
- **Continuous Monitoring & Detection:** Collection of badge logs, Wi‑Fi usage, and application logs combined with anomaly detection algorithms to flag unusual patterns and potential malicious behavior.

## Usage

1. Read the PDF report for the full case study and policy recommendations.
2. Use the key controls above as a starting checklist to secure your own events.

This project demonstrates my ability to research, design, and document a security strategy grounded in real-world scenarios and best practices.
