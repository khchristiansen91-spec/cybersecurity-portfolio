# Insider Threat Mitigation for VIP Events

This project outlines a security policy framework to mitigate insider threats at VIP events.

## Key components

- **Security Awareness Training:** Regular sessions for all staff (including temporary workers) on recognizing phishing, social engineering, and following proper procedures.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Role-based access control ensures staff only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Anonymous Reporting:** Clear, retaliation-free channels for staff to report suspicious behavior.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Collection of badge logs, Wiâ€‘Fi usage, and application logs with anomaly detection to flag unusual patterns.

See the separate case study document for detailed analysis and recommendations.
