# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains four projects demonstrating my cybersecurity skills:

1. **Insider Threat Mitigation for VIP Events** – A policy case study focusing on insider threat controls at high-profile events. It covers security awareness training, least privilege, anonymous reporting, and continuous monitoring with anomaly detection.
2. **HoneyTrap Honeypot** – A lightweight Flask honeypot that simulates a login page, logs connection attempts and user agents, and provides a simple interface to view logs. Useful for understanding attacker behavior and logging basics.
3. **Log Anomaly Detection** – A Python demo using synthetic authentication logs to train an Isolation Forest model to flag anomalous user activity. Includes log generation, feature engineering, and model training.
4. **Security Headers Scanner** – A CLI tool that checks a target website’s HTTP response headers (like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options) and reports missing values, highlighting insecure configurations.

Each project will have its own directory with a README and, where appropriate, code and configuration files.
