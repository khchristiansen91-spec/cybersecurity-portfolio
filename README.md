# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository hosts four independent projects showcasing my hands-on skills in cybersecurity, from policy and threat modelling to Python automation and machine learning.

## Projects

1. **Insider Threat Mitigation for VIP Events**  
   A case study and security policy framework for protecting high-profile events from insider threats. Includes a detailed PDF report and an executive summary.

2. **HoneyTrap Honeypot**  
   A lightweight Flask honeypot that simulates a login portal, logs unauthorized attempts, and exposes a `/logs` endpoint for analysis. An example of deception and logging techniques.

3. **Log Anomaly Detection**  
   A Python mini-project that generates synthetic authentication logs, engineers features, trains an Isolation Forest model, and outputs anomalies. Demonstrates how to build ML-based detection pipelines.

4. **Security Headers Scanner**  
   A CLI tool that checks websites for common HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) and reports missing or insecure configurations. Teaches automation and secure configuration verification.

Each project resides in its own directory with a README and the necessary code files. See each projectâ€™s README for setup and usage instructions.
