# HoneyTrap Honeypot

HoneyTrap is a lightweight educational honeypot implemented in Python using Flask.

## Project goals

- Simulate a login page to attract unauthorized login attempts.
- Log details about connection attempts (timestamp, IP address, user agent, and username).
- Provide a simple endpoint (`/logs`) to view captured events for analysis.
- Demonstrate how honeypots can help understand attacker behavior and build monitoring pipelines.

**Note:** This project is for demonstration purposes only. Do not deploy it to production environments.
